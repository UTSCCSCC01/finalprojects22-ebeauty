### Sprint Goal
The goal for this sprint is basically to finish the user stories we have on Jira. The main objective that we are aiming to finish is the basic user interface. Both user and service provider can log in & log out, navigate pages including the homepage, enter their home address, and build their profiles. Users can search for the services they want to have. 
Basically, it's having a look at the shape of this project.
