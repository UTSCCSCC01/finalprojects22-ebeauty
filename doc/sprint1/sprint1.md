### Sprint Goal
Goal for this sprint is basically to finish user stories we have on Jira. The main objective that we are aiming to finish is the basic user interface. Both user and service provider can login & logout, navigate pages including homepage, enter their own home address, build their profiles. Users can search for the services they want to have. 
Basically it's having a look at shape of this project.

As customer, I would like to be able to enter my house address so that I can make sure the service provider is willing to come to my house.

As customer, I would like to be able to search for house cleaning and landscaping so that I can find the corresponding service provider.
